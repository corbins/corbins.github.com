##About Me

Hello, I'm a Senior in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  I'm planning on pursuing a career in Security (Preferably Systems security and Vulnerability Research).  I also really like hard problems when it comes to software development.  Cut and Paste approaches are boring, so desigining new techniques and just research into the unknown in general are exciting.  Examples of this include my recent foray into the [demoscene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3TRZamP85c)

Things I like:

- C/C++
- Python
- Assembly (x86 and ARM)
- EMACS, it's superior to VIM
- Markdown

##Hobbies

I'm a huge music junkie. I tend to listen to alternative hip hop, indie/experimental/post-rock, and about every kind of electronic music.  Here are some artists I like:

- WHY?
- Mother Falcon
- World's End Girlfriend
- 13&God
- Slugabed
- Non-Prophets
- Shpongle
- Balmorhea

Making music is fun too!  I've been in the Gamelan Ensemble at UIUC for the past year, but in my free time I make a variety of music using an APC-40, MPD-18, and Akai keyboard.  I jam with a couple friends who own Guitar, Violin, and various recorders/train whistle.  Anyways, I'll try to throw stuff up on my projects page as I go.

In the world of Cinema, weird/unique == awesome.  Here's a list of things I'd recommend in no order:

- Escape From Tomorrow
- Redline (2009)
- Tetsuo The Iron Man
- Pan's Labyrinth
- Dark City
- The Cube
- 5 cm/s
