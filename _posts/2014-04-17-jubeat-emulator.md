ohai.  long time no see.

I guess I'll jump into today's blog post, as I'm ready for bed.

CS242 has a final project in it where you can make whatever you want.  So for mine I decided I would finally do a project that I've wanted to do for a long time.  Make a rhythm game!  So after thinking about it for a bit, I realized there was not really any English friendly emulators that aren't StepMania.  While it would be fun to make a IIDX/Pop'n/etc..., I thought I would start basic and make the first English friendly PC Jubeat emulator.

I just finished Week 2 of it this morning, and now have the parser running and displaying notes in real time!  I'll probably make a long rambly post about it in the future, but for now you can check out a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck3eH-uiiqU) and the [source code](https://github.com/corbins/Jubeat-Emulator).

I'll see if I update tomorrow.  I just wanted to make a quick post to maybe get myself in the habit again.
