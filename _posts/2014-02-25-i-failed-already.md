Yesterday I was a bum!  A failure!  I didn't do like 4 of my dailies on habitRPG.  I apologized to everyone in my party, but apparently they were also in the same boat as me, so I was off the hook.  I made up for it today with quite a bit of work, especially considering I spent a large portion of it inside of the ACM office.  It's so hard to get work done in there.

CS373 is kind of extremely easy this semester, my partner and I were excited to get the homework finished in 3 hours, even with me eating dinner at the same time as us working.  The exam is this Monday, but I should probably still study for it.  The format is open book, and 3 equally weighted problems.  It could go really horribly if I'm not caught up and end up bombing even one of the questions, hopefully there's both a curve and a lot of partial credit awarded.

My Clojure skills seem to not be improving very quickly for CS242 as well... I need to sit down and just program with a tutorial, but I don't have too much time for that in my schedule.  I've had to basically look up a large portion of my problems on google as I went along and patch it together.  The language definitely seems interesting, it just has such a large learning curve.  I don't think JSON parsing into cyclic mutable data structures is a good first project for a functional language.  I picked my poison though!  I make things way too hard for myself.

I've started to pick up an interest in music again... if I can get my dailies to help compensate with my school productivity I plan on adding some new goals in there.  Things I'm interested in:  Finishing up a song that involves a live recording, doing a collaboration with a few people, and looking to hone my skills in Ableton.  I've also picked up the idea of getting an electronic drumset, my friend Hosang recommended a nice looking one, but for $1000, I have to be really sure that I'm actually going to play it.  We're probably going to head to a guitar center in a couple weeks to try it out, and see if I'm actually interested in it.

We'll see what happens.  For now, I might have a Wednesday night that doesn't involve an all nighter, so I'm happy :)
