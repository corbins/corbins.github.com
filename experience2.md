Vulnerability Research and Development.  Worked on different areas in the vulnerability discovery phase including analyzing attack surfaces, source code auditing, and developing my own smart fuzzer and fuzzer framework for testing.  Dealt with browser security and applications on both x86 and ARM platforms.  Studied Exploitation Mitigation techniques such as DEP, ASLR, Sandboxing, and Code Signing.

##Co-Chair at Special Interest Group for Security in ACM (SigSAC/SigPony)
August 2012 – Present

Helped plan and run meetings/events to cover topics and tutorials in privacy (Tor, Encryption), Malware Analysis (x86, IDA Pro, OllyDBG), and other misc. such as Bitcoins and participiating in Capture The Flag contests. We have participated in CSAW '12 and Ghost in the Shellcode '13

##Android Developer for Eco Illini
August 2012 – Present

Developed an android application to provide telemetry on a hyper-fuel efficient vehicle.  This involved working with arduino to receive feedback from various sensors on the vehicle, and aggregating the data into a single android application, which when mounted on the steering wheel of the vehicle, allowed the driver to receive information about his speed, distance, and engine RPM.

##Paper Reviewer for SigComm 2013

Helped Professor Caesar review papers for SigComm '13. This involved me reading a candidate paper for the conference and analyzing it for whether I believed it qualified for the conference or not.

##Undergraduate Researcher at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
January 2012 – February 2013

Worked with Professor Sam King to develop a framework for robotic systems called "Framework for Robot Applications, K?"(FRAK). This position included group meetings to discuss relevant papers in the field, looking at variety of different tools to develop on, and writing papers.  I worked mostly in Python and C++, where I helped to set up a unifying android and web application system to control the robot and provide feedback.  I also helped to develop applications on the robot itself using Robot Operating System (ROS) and OpenCV.  Participated in the design of the framework and overall goals of the project.
